feat: Implement Community and Cloud editions

## Summary
Split Papertik into two editions:
- Community Edition: Open-source, single-user, on-demand AI generation
- Cloud Edition: Hosted service, multi-user OAuth, pre-generated AI content

## New Features

### Core
- Edition configuration system (community/cloud)
- OAuth authentication (Google, GitHub)
- JWT token management
- User model and database migration
- Full AI content generation job (cloud only)

### API
- GET /auth/config - OAuth configuration
- POST /auth/callback - OAuth callback handler
- Edition-aware authentication in all endpoints

### Scripts
- switch_edition.sh - Switch between editions
- setup_oauth.sh - Quick OAuth setup
- test_edition.py - Test edition configuration
- test_oauth.py - Test OAuth implementation

## Documentation
- EDITIONS.md - Edition comparison
- QUICKSTART.md - Quick start guide
- OAUTH_SETUP.md - OAuth setup guide
- CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md - Cloud deployment guide
- EDITION_COMPARISON.md - Detailed cost analysis
- EDITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md - Implementation summary

## Cost Analysis
- Community: Linear cost per user (¥1.5/month per user)
- Cloud: Fixed cost (¥45/month), shared across all users
- Break-even point: 30 users
- Cloud becomes more cost-effective with scale

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing APIs remain compatible
- Community edition behaves exactly like before
- Seamless migration between editions
- Database schema is backward compatible

## Testing
- Edition configuration tests
- OAuth flow tests
- API authentication tests
- Version switching tests

## Next Steps
- Frontend adaptation for both editions
- Cloud edition deployment
- User testing and feedback
- Commercial launch

Closes #XX
