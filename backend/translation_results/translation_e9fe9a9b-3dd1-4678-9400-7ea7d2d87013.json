  "summary_en": "Diverse emerging VR applications integrate streaming of high fidelity 360 video content that requires ample amounts of computation and data rate. Scalable 360 video tiling enables having elastic VR computational tasks that can be scaled adaptively in computation and data rate based on the available user and system resources. We integrate scalable 360 video tiling in an edge-client wireless multi-connectivity architecture for joint elastic task computation offloading across multiple VR users called ElasticVR. To balance the trade-offs in communication, computation, energy consumption, and QoE that arise herein, we formulate a constrained QoE and energy optimization problem that integrates the multi-user/multi-connectivity action space with the elasticity of VR computational tasks. The ElasticVR framework introduces two multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solutions, namely CPPG and IPPG. CPPG adopts a centralized training and centralized execution approach to capture the coupling between users' communication and computational demands. This leads to globally coordinated decisions at the cost of increased computational overheads and limited scalability. To address the latter challenges, we also explore an alternative strategy denoted IPPG that adopts a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. IPPG leverages shared information and parameter sharing to learn robust policies; however, during execution, each user takes action independently based on its local state information only. The decentralized execution alleviates the communication and computation overhead of centralized decision-making and improves scalability. We show that the ElasticVR framework improves the PSNR by 43.21%, while reducing the response time and energy consumption by 42.35% and 56.83%, respectively, compared with a case where no elasticity is incorporated into VR computations.",
  "summary_zh": "各类新兴VR应用集成了高保真度360度视频流传输，这需要大量的计算资源和数据速率。可扩展的360度视频分块技术能够实现弹性VR计算任务，从而可根据用户与系统的可用资源，自适应地调整计算量和数据速率。我们将可扩展的360度视频分块技术集成于一种边缘-客户端无线多连接架构中，旨在实现跨多个VR用户的联合弹性任务计算卸载，该系统称为ElasticVR。为了平衡其中产生的通信、计算、能耗与体验质量之间的权衡，我们构建了一个受约束的体验质量与能耗优化问题，该问题将多用户/多连接动作空间与VR计算任务的弹性特性相结合。ElasticVR框架提出了两种多智能体深度强化学习解决方案，即CPPG与IPPG。CPPG采用集中式训练与集中式执行的方法，以捕捉用户通信与计算需求之间的耦合关系。这种方法能够实现全局协调决策，但代价是计算开销增加和可扩展性受限。为应对这些挑战，我们还探索了另一种称为IPPG的策略，该策略采用集中式训练与分散式执行的范式。IPPG利用共享信息与参数共享来学习稳健的策略；然而，在执行阶段，每个用户仅基于其本地状态信息独立采取行动。这种分散式执行减轻了集中式决策的通信与计算开销，并提升了系统的可扩展性。实验表明，与未引入弹性机制的VR计算方案相比，ElasticVR框架将峰值信噪比提升了43.21%，同时分别将响应时间和能耗降低了42.35%和56.83%。",
