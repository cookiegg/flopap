  "summary_en": "The paper demonstrates that invariant foliations are accurate, data-efficient and practical tools for data-driven modelling of physical systems. Invariant foliations can be fitted to data that either fill the phase space or cluster about an invariant manifold. Invariant foliations can be fitted to a single trajectory or multiple trajectories. Over and underfitting are eliminated by appropriately choosing a function representation and its hyperparameters, such as polynomial orders. The paper extends invariant foliations to forced and parameter dependent systems. It is assumed that forcing is provided by a volume preserving map, and therefore the forcing can be periodic, quasi-periodic or even chaotic. The method utilises full trajectories, hence it is able to predict long-term dynamics accurately. We take into account if a forced system is reducible to an autonomous system about a steady state, similar to how Floquet theory guarantees reducibility for periodically forced systems. In order to find an invariant manifold, multiple invariant foliations are calculated in the neighbourhood of the invariant manifold. Some of the invariant foliations can be linear, while others nonlinear but only defined in a small neighbourhood of an invariant manifold, which reduces the number of parameters to be identified. An invariant manifold is recovered as the zero level set of one or more of the foliations. To interpret the results, the identified mathematical models are transformed to a canonical form and instantaneous frequency and damping information are calculated.",
  "summary_zh": "本文论证了不变叶层是物理系统数据驱动建模中精确、数据高效且实用的工具。不变叶层可适用于填满相空间的数据，也可适用于聚集在不变流形附近的数据。该工具既适用于单条轨迹，也适用于多条轨迹。通过适当选择函数表示形式及其超参数（如多项式阶数），可有效避免过拟合与欠拟合问题。本文将不变叶层方法拓展至受迫及参数依赖系统。假设外力由保体积映射提供，因此外力可为周期性、准周期性甚至混沌性。该方法利用完整轨迹，故能精确预测长期动力学行为。我们考虑了受迫系统是否可约化为稳态附近的自治系统，类似于弗洛凯理论对周期受迫系统可约化性的保证。为寻找不变流形，需在不变流形邻域内计算多个不变叶层。其中部分叶层可为线性，其余可为非线性但仅定义于不变流形的小邻域内，此举可减少待辨识参数数量。不变流形可通过一个或多个叶层的零水平集重构获得。为阐释结果，将已辨识的数学模型转化为规范形式，并计算瞬时频率与阻尼信息。",
