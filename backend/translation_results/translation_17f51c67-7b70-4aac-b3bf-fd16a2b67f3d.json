  "summary_en": "Customized video generation aims to produce videos that faithfully preserve the subject's appearance from reference images while maintaining temporally consistent motion from reference videos. Existing methods struggle to ensure both subject appearance similarity and motion pattern consistency due to the lack of object-level guidance for subject and motion. To address this, we propose SMRABooth, which leverages the self-supervised encoder and optical flow encoder to provide object-level subject and motion representations. These representations are aligned with the model during the LoRA fine-tuning process. Our approach is structured in three core stages: (1) We exploit subject representations via a self-supervised encoder to guide subject alignment, enabling the model to capture overall structure of subject and enhance high-level semantic consistency. (2) We utilize motion representations from an optical flow encoder to capture structurally coherent and object-level motion trajectories independent of appearance. (3) We propose a subject-motion association decoupling strategy that applies sparse LoRAs injection across both locations and timing, effectively reducing interference between subject and motion LoRAs. Extensive experiments show that SMRABooth excels in subject and motion customization, maintaining consistent subject appearance and motion patterns, proving its effectiveness in controllable text-to-video generation.",
  "summary_zh": "定制化视频生成旨在生成既忠实保持参考图像中主体外观，又延续参考视频中时序一致运动模式的视频。现有方法由于缺乏针对主体与运动的物体级引导，难以同时保证主体外观相似性与运动模式一致性。为此，我们提出SMRABooth方法，通过自监督编码器与光流编码器分别提取物体级的主体表征与运动表征，并在LoRA微调过程中将这些表征与模型对齐。我们的方法包含三个核心阶段：（1）利用自监督编码器提取主体表征以引导主体对齐，使模型能够捕捉主体的整体结构并增强高层语义一致性；（2）通过光流编码器获取运动表征，以捕捉与外观无关、结构连贯的物体级运动轨迹；（3）提出一种主体-运动关联解耦策略，在空间位置与时间维度上实施稀疏LoRA注入，有效减少主体与运动LoRA之间的相互干扰。大量实验表明，SMRABooth在主体与运动定制化方面表现优异，能够保持主体外观与运动模式的一致性，证明了其在可控文本到视频生成中的有效性。",
