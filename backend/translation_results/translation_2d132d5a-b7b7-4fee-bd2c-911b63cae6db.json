  "summary_en": "The development of machine learning (ML) models based on computed tomography (CT) imaging modality has been a major focus of recent research in the medical imaging domain. Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency. The proposed approach outperformed the cubical complex method, achieving average improvement of 10.38%, 6.94%, 2.06%, 11.58%, and 8.51% in accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, respectively, across all datasets. Finally, we provide a convenient python package, Patch-TDA, to facilitate the utilization of the proposed approach.",
  "summary_zh": "基于计算机断层扫描（CT）成像模式的机器学习模型开发，已成为医学影像领域近期研究的重要方向。引入稳健的特征工程方法能够显著提升此类模型的性能。拓扑数据分析作为代数拓扑学领域的新兴方法，主要从拓扑学视角解析数据，以提取更深层次的洞察和高维结构特征。持续同调作为拓扑数据分析的核心工具，能够从数据中提取连通分量、循环结构和空洞等拓扑特征。目前从三维CT图像构建持续同调的常用方法是采用三维立方复形滤波技术，这种适用于网格结构数据的方法虽被广泛采用，但其性能表现并不稳定，且在处理高分辨率CT图像时可能面临计算复杂度的挑战。本研究提出一种专为容积医学影像数据（特别是CT模态）设计的创新型基于图像块的持续同调构建方法。通过对多个三维CT图像数据集开展广泛实验，系统分析了所提方法在不同参数下的性能表现，并以三维立方复形算法作为基准进行对比验证。实验结果表明，基于图像块的拓扑数据分析方法在分类性能与时间效率方面均具有显著优势。该方法在所有数据集上的准确率、AUC值、灵敏度、特异度和F1分数分别平均提升了10.38%、6.94%、2.06%、11.58%和8.51%，全面超越了立方复形方法。最后，我们提供了便捷的Python软件包Patch-TDA，以促进该方法的实际应用。",
