  "summary_en": "This paper presents the largest known benchmark dataset for road damage assessment and road alignment, and provides 18 baseline models trained on the CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset's post-disaster small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery from 10 federally declared disasters, addressing three challenges within prior post-disaster road damage assessment datasets. While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\\% Macro IoU. If spatial alignment is not considered, approximately 8\\% (11km) of adverse conditions on road lines will be labeled incorrectly, with approximately 9\\% (59km) of road lines misaligned off the actual road. These dynamics are gaps that should be addressed by the ML, CV, and robotics communities to enable more effective and informed decision-making during disasters.",
  "summary_zh": "本文提出了当前已知规模最大的道路损伤评估与道路对齐基准数据集，并基于CRASAR-U-DRIODs数据集中来自10次联邦宣告灾害事件后的小型无人机系统（sUAS）影像，训练了18个基线模型，以解决现有灾后道路损伤评估数据集中存在的三个挑战。尽管已有灾害道路损伤评估数据集，但目前尚未形成标准化实践，因为现有公开数据集要么规模有限，要么依赖分辨率不足的影像，难以检测应急管理者关注的关键现象。此外，尽管已有针对此任务开发的机器学习（ML）系统，但尚未有经过实际业务验证的案例。本研究通过以下工作克服了这些局限：依据10类标注体系对657.25公里道路进行标注，并在2024年黛比与海伦飓风应急响应期间训练并部署了ML模型。针对实践中观测到的道路线空间错位问题，本研究提供了9,184条道路线调整数据以实现先验道路线的空间对齐。实验发现，当18个基线模型应用于现实世界中未对齐的道路线时，模型宏观交并比平均下降5.596%。若不考虑空间对齐，约8%（11公里）的道路不良状况将被错误标注，同时约9%（59公里）的道路线会偏离实际道路位置。这些机制缺陷需要机器学习、计算机视觉与机器人学领域共同关注，以提升灾害期间决策的有效性与科学性。",
