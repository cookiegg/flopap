  "summary_en": "Modern cities increasingly rely on ridesharing services for on-demand transportation, which offer consumers convenience and mobility across the globe. However, these marketed consumer affordances give rise to burdens and vulnerabilities that drivers shoulder alone, without adequate infrastructures for labor regulations or consumer-led advocacy. To effectively and sustainably advance protections and oversight for drivers, consumers must first be aware of the labor, logistics and costs involved with ridehail driving. To motivate consumers to practice more socially responsible consumption behaviors and foster solidarity with drivers, we explore the potential for gamified in-ride interactions to facilitate engagement with real (and lived) driver experiences. Through nine workshops with 19 drivers and 15 passengers, we surface how gamified in-ride interactions revealed passenger knowledge gaps around latent ridehail conditions, prompt reflection and shifts in perception of their relative power and consumption behaviors, and highlight drivers' preferences for creating more immersive and contextualized service experiences, and identify opportunities to design safe and appropriate passenger-driver interactions that motivate solidarity with drivers. In sum, we advance conceptual understandings of in-ride social and managerial relations, demonstrate potential for future worker advocacy in algorithmically-managed labor, and offer design guidelines for more human-centered workplace technologies.",
  "summary_zh": "现代城市日益依赖网约车服务提供按需出行，这种服务为全球消费者带来了便利与移动性。然而，这些市场化的消费者赋能却导致了司机独自承担的重负与风险，且缺乏足够的劳动监管或消费者倡导机制。为有效且可持续地推进对司机的保护与监督，消费者首先需要了解网约车驾驶所涉及的劳动、运营逻辑及成本。为激励消费者践行更具社会责任的消费行为，并与司机建立团结关系，本研究探索了游戏化的车内互动在促进乘客了解司机真实（及切身）经历方面的潜力。通过对19名司机和15名乘客开展的九场工作坊，我们发现：游戏化的车内互动能揭示乘客对网约车隐性状况的认知空白，促使其反思并转变对自身相对权力和消费行为的认知，同时凸显司机对创造更具沉浸感和情境化服务体验的偏好。研究进一步识别了设计安全、恰当的司乘互动以激发司机团结意识的可能性。总之，本研究深化了对车内社会与管理关系的理论理解，展现了算法管理劳动中未来劳动者倡导的潜力，并为设计更以人为本的工作场所技术提供了指导原则。",
