  "summary_en": "Penetration testing is a cornerstone of cybersecurity, traditionally driven by manual, time-intensive processes. As systems grow in complexity, there is a pressing need for more scalable and efficient testing methodologies. This systematic literature review examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping penetration testing, analyzing 58 peer-reviewed studies from major academic databases. Our findings reveal that while AI-assisted pentesting is still in its early stages, notable progress is underway, particularly through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which was the focus of 77% of the reviewed works. Most research centers on the discovery and exploitation phases of pentesting, where AI shows the greatest promise in automating repetitive tasks, optimizing attack strategies, and improving vulnerability identification. Real-world applications remain limited but encouraging, including the European Space Agency's PenBox and various open-source tools. These demonstrate AI's potential to streamline attack path analysis, analyze complex network topology, and reduce manual workload. However, challenges persist: current models often lack flexibility and are underdeveloped for the reconnaissance and post-exploitation phases of pentesting. Applications involving Large Language Models (LLMs) remain relatively under-researched, pointing to a promising direction for future exploration. This paper offers a critical overview of AI's current and potential role in penetration testing, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and organizations aiming to enhance security assessments through advanced automation or looking for gaps in existing research.",
  "summary_zh": "渗透测试是网络安全的基石，传统上依赖于人工驱动且耗时密集的流程。随着系统复杂性日益增加，对更具可扩展性和高效性的测试方法的需求愈发迫切。本系统性文献综述探讨了人工智能如何重塑渗透测试，分析了来自主要学术数据库的58篇同行评审研究。研究发现表明，尽管人工智能辅助的渗透测试仍处于早期阶段，但已取得显著进展，其中强化学习尤为突出——在77%的 reviewed 研究中成为焦点。现有研究多集中于渗透测试的发现与利用阶段，人工智能在这些环节展现出自动化重复任务、优化攻击策略及提升漏洞识别能力的巨大潜力。实际应用案例虽有限但令人鼓舞，包括欧洲空间局的PenBox及各类开源工具。这些案例证明了人工智能在简化攻击路径分析、解析复杂网络拓扑及降低人工工作量方面的潜力。然而挑战依然存在：现有模型往往缺乏灵活性，在渗透测试的侦察与后利用阶段发展尚不成熟。涉及大语言模型的应用研究仍相对不足，这为未来探索指明了富有前景的方向。本文批判性地概述了人工智能在渗透测试中当前及潜在的作用，为旨在通过先进自动化技术增强安全评估的研究者、从业者及组织，以及寻求现有研究空白领域的人员提供了有价值的见解。",
