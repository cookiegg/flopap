  "summary_en": "In the last five years, expected shortfall (ES) and stressed ES (SES) have become key required regulatory measures of market risk in the banking sector, especially following events such as the global financial crisis. Thus, finding ways to optimize their estimation is of great importance. We extend the application of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) to the estimation of 10-day 97.5% ES and stressed ES, building on prior work applying DBNs to value at risk. Using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the equities trading desk of a US bank, we compare the performance of three DBN structure-learning algorithms with several traditional market risk models, using either the normal or the skewed Student's t return distributions. Backtesting shows that all models fail to produce statistically accurate ES and SES forecasts at the 2.5% level, reflecting the difficulty of modeling extreme tail behavior. For ES, the EGARCH(1,1) model (normal) produces the most accurate forecasts, while, for SES, the GARCH(1,1) model (normal) performs best. All distribution-dependent models deteriorate substantially when using the skewed Student's t distribution. The DBNs perform comparably to the historical simulation model, but their contribution to tail prediction is limited by the small weight assigned to their one-day-ahead forecasts within the return distribution. Future research should examine weighting schemes that enhance the influence of forward-looking DBN forecasts on tail risk estimation.",
  "summary_zh": "过去五年间，预期损失（ES）与压力预期损失（SES）已成为银行业市场风险监管的核心指标，这在全球金融危机等事件后尤为显著。因此，优化其估计方法具有重要意义。本研究基于先前将动态贝叶斯网络（DBN）应用于风险价值度量的工作，进一步拓展DBN在10日97.5%置信水平的ES与压力ES估计中的应用。以标普500指数作为美国银行股票交易业务的代理变量，我们比较了三种DBN结构学习算法与多种传统市场风险模型的性能，其中收益率分布分别采用正态分布与偏斜学生t分布。回溯测试表明，所有模型均未能生成在2.5%水平上统计精确的ES与SES预测，这反映出极端尾部行为建模的困难性。对于ES而言，EGARCH(1,1)模型（正态分布）的预测最为准确；而对于SES，GARCH(1,1)模型（正态分布）表现最佳。当采用偏斜学生t分布时，所有依赖分布假设的模型性能均显著下降。动态贝叶斯网络的表现与历史模拟模型相当，但其对尾部预测的贡献受限于单日前瞻性预测在收益率分布中所占的较小权重。未来研究应探索能够增强前瞻性DBN预测对尾部风险估计影响的权重配置方案。",
