  "summary_en": "Classical spectral graph theory and graph signal processing rely on a symmetry principle: undirected graphs induce symmetric (self-adjoint) adjacency/Laplacian operators, yielding orthogonal eigenbases and energy-preserving Fourier expansions. Real-world networks are typically directed and hence asymmetric, producing non-self-adjoint and frequently non-normal operators for which orthogonality fails and spectral coordinates can be ill-conditioned. In this paper we develop an original harmonic-analysis framework for directed networks centered on the \\emph{adjacency} operator. We propose a \\emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) built from left/right eigenvectors, formulate directed ``frequency'' and filtering in the non-Hermitian setting, and quantify how asymmetry and non-normality affect stability via condition numbers and a departure-from-normality functional. We prove exact synthesis/analysis identities under diagonalizability, establish sampling-and-reconstruction guarantees for BGFT-bandlimited signals, and derive perturbation/stability bounds that explain why naive orthogonal-GFT assumptions break down on non-normal directed graphs. A simulation protocol compares undirected versus directed cycles (asymmetry without non-normality) and a perturbed directed cycle (genuine non-normality), demonstrating that BGFT yields coherent reconstruction and filtering across asymmetric regimes.",
  "summary_zh": "经典谱图理论与图信号处理依赖于对称性原理：无向图诱导对称（自伴）的邻接/拉普拉斯算子，从而产生正交特征基和能量守恒的傅里叶展开。现实世界网络通常具有方向性，因而呈现非对称性，其产生的非自伴且常为非正规的算子会导致正交性失效，谱坐标可能呈现病态特性。本文针对有向网络，以**邻接**算子为核心，建立了一套原创的调和分析框架。我们提出一种基于左/右特征向量的**双正交图傅里叶变换**，在非厄米特框架下构建了有向“频率”与滤波理论，并通过条件数及偏离正规性泛函量化了非对称性与非正规性对稳定性的影响。我们在可对角化条件下证明了精确的合成/分析恒等式，为BGFT带限信号建立了采样与重构的理论保证，并推导了扰动/稳定性界，从而解释了为何在非正规有向图上采用朴素的正交图傅里叶变换假设会失效。通过仿真实验，我们比较了无向环与有向环（仅具非对称性而无非正规性）及扰动有向环（具真实非正规性）的表现，证明BGFT能在不同非对称体系中实现一致的重构与滤波效果。",
