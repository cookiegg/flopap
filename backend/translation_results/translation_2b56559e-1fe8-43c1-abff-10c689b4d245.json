  "summary_en": "This study examines the development and deployment of a Generative AI proof-of-concept (POC) designed to support lecturers in a vocational education setting in Singapore. Employing a user-centred, mixed-methods design process, we co-developed an AI chatbot with lecturers to address recurring instructional challenges during exam preparation, specifically managing repetitive questions and scaling feedback delivery. The POC achieved its primary operational goals: lecturers reported streamlined workflows, reduced cognitive load, and observed improved student confidence in navigating course content. However, the deployment yielded unexpected insights into student learning behaviours. Despite enhanced teaching processes, performance data revealed no significant improvement in overall student assessment outcomes. Deep analysis of interaction logs identified concerning patterns, including self-efficacy-driven dependency, \"metacognitive laziness\" (cognitive offloading), and divergent usage strategies. While high-ability students leveraged the tool for strategic verification, low-ability students frequently used it to bypass cognitive effort, potentially exacerbating performance gaps. These findings suggest that Generative AI's educational influence extends beyond instructional efficiency to shape cognitive engagement, self-regulation, and learner equity. The study raises consequential design questions regarding how AI tools can be engineered to minimise dependency, scaffold metacognitive development, and calibrate support across varying ability levels. We conclude that while Generative AI can substantially enhance the teaching experience, achieving meaningful learning gains requires rigorous attention to learner behaviour and the equitable design of AI-supported environments.",
  "summary_zh": "本研究探讨了一款生成式人工智能概念验证系统的开发与部署，该系统旨在为新加坡职业教育机构的讲师提供支持。我们采用以用户为中心的混合方法设计流程，与讲师共同开发了一款人工智能聊天机器人，以应对备考期间反复出现的教学挑战，特别是处理重复性问题和扩大反馈覆盖面。该概念验证实现了其核心操作目标：讲师反馈工作流程得到简化，认知负荷降低，并观察到学生在掌握课程内容方面的信心有所提升。然而，部署过程意外地揭示了学生的学习行为特征。尽管教学过程得到改善，但绩效数据显示学生的总体评估成绩并未出现显著提高。对交互日志的深入分析发现了一些值得关注的模式，包括自我效能感驱动的依赖性、“元认知惰性”（认知卸载）以及差异化的使用策略。高能力学生倾向于利用该工具进行策略性验证，而低能力学生则频繁用它来规避认知努力，这可能加剧成绩差距。这些发现表明，生成式人工智能的教育影响不仅限于教学效率，更延伸至认知参与、自我调节和学习者公平性层面。本研究提出了关键的设计问题：如何设计人工智能工具以最小化依赖性、搭建元认知发展支架，并为不同能力水平的学生提供精准支持。我们的结论是，尽管生成式人工智能能显著提升教学体验，但要实现有意义的学习成效，必须严格关注学习者行为，并致力于构建公平的人工智能支持环境。",
