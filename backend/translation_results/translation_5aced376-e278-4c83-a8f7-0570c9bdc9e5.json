  "summary_en": "Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) have shown strong capability in wireless communications, yet existing works mainly rely on their generalized knowledge across environments while overlooking the potential gains of environment-specific adaptation. Directly fine-tuning LAMs for adaptation is often impractical due to prohibitive training costs, low inference efficiency in multi-user scenarios, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting, in addition to the limited accessibility of model parameters. To address these limitations, we establish a collaborative framework for air interface. In this framework, unlike prior approaches that either depend solely on LAMs or require direct fine-tuning, LAMs are exploited as a universal channel knowledge base while small artificial intelligence models (SAMs) are employed as lightweight plugins to capture environment-specific knowledge, facilitating efficient environment-specific adaptation of LAMs. Subsequently, we instantiate this framework for CSI feedback tasks, and develop a large and small collaboration framework for CSI feedback, referred to as LASCO. LASCO operates by letting the base LAM produce an initial CSI reconstruction, learning the environment-induced reconstruction shift through a reference SAM and a proxy SAM, and transferring this shift back to the LAM. To further enhance adaptability, we introduce elastic-LASCO (E-LASCO), which augments LASCO with learnable collaboration coefficients that control the contribution of LAMs and SAMs across different environments. Numerical results demonstrate that LASCO and E-LASCO enables LAMs to achieve environment-specific performance gains with significantly reduced training costs, lower data collection requirements, and faster adaptation speed.",
  "summary_zh": "大规模人工智能模型在无线通信领域展现出强大能力，但现有研究主要依赖其跨环境泛化知识，忽视了环境特异性适配的潜在增益。直接对大模型进行微调适配往往不切实际，原因包括：训练成本过高、多用户场景下推理效率低下、存在灾难性遗忘风险，以及模型参数的可访问性受限。为突破这些限制，本文建立了空口协同框架。该框架摒弃了以往单纯依赖大模型或直接微调的方法，转而将大模型作为通用信道知识库，同时部署轻量化的小模型作为插件来捕获环境特异性知识，从而实现大模型的高效环境适配。基于此框架，我们针对信道状态信息反馈任务进行实例化，开发了名为LASCO的大-小模型协同反馈框架。LASCO的运行机制是：先由基础大模型生成初始CSI重构，通过参考小模型和代理小模型学习环境导致的重构偏移，再将此偏移量回传至大模型。为进一步提升适配能力，我们提出弹性LASCO框架（E-LASCO），通过引入可学习的协同系数来动态调控大模型与小模型在不同环境中的贡献权重。数值实验表明，LASCO与E-LASCO能使大模型以显著降低的训练成本、更少的数据需求和更快的适配速度，实现环境特异性的性能提升。",
