  "summary_en": "Accurate segmentation of infant brain MRI is essential for quantifying developmental changes in structure and complexity. However, ongoing myelination and reduced tissue contrast make automated segmentation particularly challenging. This study systematically compared segmentation accuracy and its impact on volumetric and fractal dimension (FD) estimates in infant brain MRI using the Baby Open Brains (BOB) dataset (71 scans, 1-9 months). Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts. Volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures, indicating that segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation. Overall, SynthSeg provided the most reliable volumetric and FD results for paediatric MRI, yet small morphological differences in volume and FD should be interpreted with caution due to segmentation-related uncertainty.",
  "summary_zh": "婴儿脑部磁共振成像（MRI）的精确分割对于量化脑部结构与复杂性的发育变化至关重要。然而，持续的髓鞘化进程及较低的组织对比度使得自动分割尤为困难。本研究基于婴儿开放脑（BOB）数据集（71例扫描，1-9月龄），系统比较了分割准确性及其对婴儿脑部MRI容量与分形维数（FD）估计的影响。研究以专家标注为金标准，采用戴斯系数、交并比、95%豪斯多夫距离和归一化互信息等指标，评估了SynthSeg和SamSeg两种方法。在所有质量指标上，SynthSeg均优于SamSeg（主要脑区平均戴斯系数>0.8），其容量估计值与人工参考值高度吻合（平均偏差+4% [-28% - 71%]）。SamSeg则系统性高估了脑室及全脑容量（平均偏差+76% [-12% - 190%]）。分割准确性随月龄增长而提高，这与髓鞘化过程中组织对比度的增加趋势一致。分形维数分析显示，SynthSeg与专家分割结果存在显著的脑区差异性；Bland-Altman一致性界限表明，由分割差异导致的FD变异度超过了多数发育队列研究中报告的组间差异。各脑结构的容量偏差与FD偏差呈正相关，表明分割偏差会直接影响FD估计。总体而言，SynthSeg为儿科MRI提供了最可靠的容量与FD分析结果，但由于分割相关不确定性的存在，对容量与FD中细微形态学差异的解释仍需审慎。",
