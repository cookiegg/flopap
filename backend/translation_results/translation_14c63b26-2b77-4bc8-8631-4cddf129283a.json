  "summary_en": "In the first part, we develop layered monoidal theories - a generalisation of monoidal theories combining descriptions of a system at several levels. Via their representation as string diagrams, monoidal theories provide a graphical syntax with a visually intuitive notions of information flow and composition. Layered monoidal theories allow mixing several monoidal theories (together with translations between them) within the same string diagram, while retaining mathematical precision and semantic interpretability. We define three flavours of layered monoidal theories, provide a recursively generated syntax for each, and construct a free-forgetful adjunction with respect to three closely related semantics: opfibrations, fibrations and deflations. We motivate the general theory by providing several examples from existing literature.\n  In the second part, we develop a formal approach to retrosynthesis - the process of backwards reaction search in synthetic chemistry. Chemical processes are treated at three levels of abstraction: (1) (formal) reactions encode all chemically feasible combinatorial rearrangements of molecules, (2) reaction schemes encode transformations applicable to 'patches' of molecules (including the functional groups), and (3) disconnection rules encode local chemical rewrite rules applicable to a single bond or atom at a time. We show that the three levels are tightly linked: the reactions are generated by the reaction schemes, while there is a functorial translation from the disconnection rules to the reactions. Moreover, the translation from the disconnection rules to the reactions is shown to be sound, complete and universal - allowing one to treat the disconnection rules as a formal syntax with the semantics provided by the reactions. We tie together the two parts by providing a formalisation of retrosynthesis within a certain layered monoidal theory.",
  "summary_zh": "在第一部分中，我们发展了分层幺半群理论——这是幺半群理论的推广，结合了对系统在多个层次上的描述。通过其弦图表示，幺半群理论提供了一种图形语法，具有视觉上直观的信息流与复合概念。分层幺半群理论允许在同一弦图中混合多个幺半群理论（及其间的转换），同时保持数学精确性与语义可解释性。我们定义了三种类型的分层幺半群理论，为每种类型提供了递归生成的语法，并针对三种紧密相关的语义（opfibrations、fibrations 和 deflations）构造了自由-遗忘伴随函子。我们通过现有文献中的多个实例来阐明这一般性理论的动机。",
